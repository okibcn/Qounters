# Qounters-

Spice up your Beat Saber HUD with a variety of configurable ~~Counters~~ Qounters, which can display a wide variety of stats in an even wider variety of ways.
[Caeden117's *Counters+*](https://github.com/Caeden117/CountersPlus) mod was initially created for PC. Later it was ported to Beat Saber Quest and maintained by [danrouse](https://github.com/danrouse/bsq-qounters-minus). This is an unofficial port for Beat Saber Quest v1.17.1



Configure your Qounters from the Mod Settings menu (Main menu → Settings (gear icon) → Mod Settings → Qounters-). After making changes, you can click the big blue _Test_ button to preview your configuration.

Settings can be loaded from a PC *Counters+* configuration file! Rename your `CountersPlus.json` to `qounters-minus.json` and upload it through BMBF after installing Qounters-.

Everything covered by the original base mod is supported, *except*:
- The settings menu is store brand
- Canvas/HUD settings are not yet supported

*Today's interface has been brought to you by the letter **Q***.

## Custom Qounters

Mod developers can easily write Custom Qounters as standalone mods with Qounters- as a dependency. Creating, positioning, and configuring the Custom Qounters is all handled by Qounters-.
